A porter stemmer written in Go as part of my MSc thesis.
Algorithm described here: http://tartarus.org/~martin/PorterStemmer/index.html

Function names are as close as possible to the original algorithm. You should
use the "Porter" method to stem your words.

I am not maintaining this code anymore, but thought it might be useful to
someone.
